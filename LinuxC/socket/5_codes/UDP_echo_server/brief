1.echo service:return a copy of whatever the client sends to it

2.echo service operates on both UDP and TCP port 7.It's a reserved port,so it must be run with superuser priviliges

3.The UDP echo server continuously reads datagram,returning a copy of each datagram to the sender.
  Since the server only needs to handle a single message at a time,a iterative server design suffices.

4.As for client program,it expects the name of the host on which the server resides as its first cmd-line argumnet 
  It executes a loop in which it sends each of its remaining cmd-line argumnets to the server as seperate datagrams,and reads and prints each response datagram sent back by the server

5.Concurrent TCP echo server
  Multiple clients can be serviced simultaneously
  Main points:
  1)Since the server create new process for each client connection,we must ensure the zombies are raped
    Do it within a SIGCHLD handler
  2)The main body of the server consists of a for loop to accept client connection and then use fork() to create child process that invokes handleRequest() to handle the client
    In the meantime,the parent continues around the for loop to accept next client connection 
  3)We can place an upper limit on the amount of child process that the server can create
    In order to prevent an attacker from attempting a remote fork bomb by using the service to create so many child process on the server system that the server becomes unusable
    Once the limit is reached,we can temporarily stop accepting connections or alternatively accept the connection and immediately close it 
  4)After each fork(),the fd for listening and connected sockets are duplicated in the child
    It means both parent and child can communicate with client using the connected socket
    But only the child needs to perfom such communication.
    So parent should close the fd for connected socket immediately after the fork().Otherwise the parent may eventually run out of the fds
    Since the child does't accept the connection,it closes its duplicate of the fd for the listening socket
