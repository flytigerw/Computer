<dl compact>
<dt>(a)
<dd>
<code class=var>6,1,2,7,4</code> is a path in the graph and no vertex
is repeated. So it is a simple path.
<br>
<br>
<dt>(b)
<dd>
<code class=var>1,2,3,4</code> is not a path in the graph because
<code class=var>(3,4)</code> is not an edge of the graph.
Therefore, it is not a simple path.
<br>
<br>
<dt>(c)
<dd>
Even though
<code class=var>7,2,3,2,1,6</code> is a path in the graph,
it is not a simple path because vertex <code class=var>2</code>
which is an interior path vertex is repeated.
<br>
<br>
<dt>(d)
<dd>
<code class=var>4,5,7,2</code> is not a path in the graph because
<code class=var>(4,5)</code> is not an edge of the graph.
Therefore, it is not a simple path.
