No, the greedy algorithm no longer guarantees to provide change using
the fewest number of coins.
For example, suppose we want to provide <code class=code>48</code> cents in change.
The greedy algorithm
will give out three <code class=code>14</code> cent coins, one nickel, and one penny; for a total of
five coins.
An optimal algorithm will give out four <code class=code>12</code>
cent coins in change.
