The diagram of Figure 11.1 satisfies the definition of a tree.
The element set is {<code class=code>Joe, Ann, Mary, John, Mark, Sue, Chris</code>}.
This is a finite nonempty set.
The root node is the node for <code class=var>Joe</code>.
The remaining elements are partitioned into 3 subtrees (the fact that these are
subtrees may be verified recursively).
<br><br>
The root is Joe, its degree is 3 and its level is 1.
The level 2 nodes are Ann, Mary and John and the level 3 nodes are Mark, Sue, and Chris.
<br><br>
The degrees of Ann, Mary, John, Mark, Sue and Chris are, respectively,
0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0.
<br><br>
The depth or height of the tree is <code class=var>3</code>.
