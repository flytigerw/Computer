If our objective is to determine whether or not there is a path from the
maze entrance to the maze exit, we can use either a stack or a queue.
However, to reconstruct the path to the maze exit, it is necessary
to use a stack.
To enable path reconstruction using a queue, we must use code similar to the
wire routing code.
