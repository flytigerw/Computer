The steps in the proof are:
<ol>
<li>
The number of groups (and hence medians) is
<code class=var>floor(n/9)</code>
<li>
At least
<code class=var>ceil(floor(n/9)/2)</code>
of these
<code class=var>floor(n/9)</code> medians are less than or equal to the
pivot element.
<li>
In each group, at least <code class=var>5</code> elements are less than
or equal to the group median.
<li>
Therefore, at least
<code class=var>5 * ceil(floor(n/9)/2) &gt;=
2.5 * floor(n/9)
</code> elements are less than or equal to the pivot.
<li>
Therefore, at most
<code class=var>n - 2.5 * floor(n/9)</code>
elements are greater than the pivot.
<li>
From the way the partitioning code works, we see that
the right segment has maximum size when the number of elements
that are greater than the pivot is maximum and the remaining elements
are equal to the pivot.  At most half of these remaining elements
can end up in the right segment because each element in the right segment
that is equal to the pivot got into the right segment
as a result of a swap with an element that is equal to or smaller than
the pivot. The swapped element must be in the left segment when done.
<li>
Therefore, the size of the right segment is at most
<code class=var>n - 2.5 * floor(n/9) + 1.25 * floor(n/9)
<br>
= n - 1.25 * floor(n/9)
<br>
&lt; n - 1.25 (n/9 - 1)
<br>
= 31n/36 + 1.25
<br>
&lt;= 63n/72 for n &gt;= 90</code>

The steps in the proof are:
<ol>
<li>
The number of groups (and hence medians) is
<code class=var>floor(n/5)</code>
<li>
At least
<code class=var>ceil(floor(n/5)/2)</code>
of these
<code class=var>floor(n/5)</code> medians are less than or equal to the
pivot element.
<li>
In each group, at least <code class=var>3</code> elements are less than
or equal to the group median.
<li>
Therefore, at least
<code class=var>3 * ceil(floor(n/5)/2) &gt;=
1.5 * floor(n/9)
</code> elements are less than or equal to the pivot.
<li>
Therefore, at most
<code class=var>n - 1.5 * floor(n/5)</code>
elements are greater than the pivot.
<li>
Since all elements are distinct, the size of the right segment is at most
<code class=var>n - 1.5 * floor(n/5)
<br>
&lt;= n - 1.5 (n/5 - 4/5)
<br>
= 0.7n + 1.2
<br>
&lt;= 3n/4 for n &gt;= 24</code>
