For the induction base we use <code class=var>n = 0</code>.
For this number of disks the program requires no disks to be
moved and so works correctly.  For the induction hypothesis, assume
that the program is correct when
the number of disks is some arbitrary nonnegative integer
<code class=var>m</code>.  In the induction step we must show that
the program works correctly when the number of disks is
<code class=var>m + 1</code>.
When the number of disks is
<code class=var>m + 1</code>, the program first moves the top
<code class=var>m</code> disks from tower
<code class=var>x</code> to tower
<code class=var>z</code> using tower
<code class=var>y</code> for intermediate storage.  The program completely
ignores the fact that disk
<code class=var>m + 1</code> is at the bottom of tower
<code class=var>x</code>.  From the induction hypothesis we conclude that
the program correctly moves the top
<code class=var>m</code> disks to tower
<code class=var>z</code> except possibly for errors caused by the
presence of disk
<code class=var>m + 1</code> is at the bottom of tower
<code class=var>x</code>.  Since disk
<code class=var>m + 1</code> is the largest disk it can cause no errors.
Next, disk
<code class=var>m + 1</code> is moved to tower
<code class=var>y</code>.  Since this tower has no disk on it, this
move of disk
<code class=var>m + 1</code> is legal.
Finally the program moves disks <code class=var>1</code> through
<code class=var>m</code> from tower
<code class=var>z</code> to tower
<code class=var>y</code> completely ignoring the fact that disk
<code class=var>m + 1</code> is at the bottom of tower
<code class=var>y</code>.  From our correctness proof for the moving
of the top
<code class=var>m</code> disks from tower
<code class=var>x</code> to tower
<code class=var>z</code>, it follows that the moving of these disks
from tower 
<code class=var>z</code> to tower
<code class=var>y</code> is done correctly.
