The class list of Example 10.1 is a possibility.
During the semester, you may want to retrieve and
update student records at random (for example, a student may
want to know how he/she is doing relative to the rest of the
class). At the end of the semester (or after each assignment
or exam is graded), the instructor may print the class list with scores
in alphabetical (requiring sequential access) order.
Grade/score entry may also be done in alphabetical
order.
