<dt>(a)
<dd>
After the last insertion, the
</code>12</code> chains are
<code class=var>[empty, (14), empty, (42), empty, (70), empty,
(7), (8, 21, 34), empty, empty, (11), (25, 38)]</code>.
<br><br>
<dt>(b)
<dd>
The loading factor is <code class=var>10/13 = 0.77</code>.
<br><br>
<dt>(c)
<dd>
The number of buckets examined during an unsuccessful
search that starts at home bucket <code class=var>i</code>
is <code class=var>[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 1, 2]</code>.
The average is <code class=var>10/13 = 0.77</code>.
<br><br>
<dt>(d)
<dd>
When searching for each of <code class=var>[7, 42, 25, 70, 14, 38, 8, 21, 34, 11]</code>
the number of buckets examined is
<code class=var>[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1]</code>. The average is
<code class=var>14/10 = 1.4</code>.
<br><br>
<dt>(e)
<dd>
When the loading density is <code class=var>0.77</code>, the formulas
yield <code class=var>0.77</code> and <code class=var>1.39</code>
as the expected value for the average number of buckets examined
in an unsuccessful and a successful search, respectively.
These numbers are almost identical to those in our example. Despite this,
you should
remember
that the formulas do not tell you what will happen in an
individual case but what happens on average as the number of elements in the
table becomes very large.
