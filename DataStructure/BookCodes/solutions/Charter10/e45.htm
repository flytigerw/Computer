Yes, the compressed file produced by LZW compression can be longer
than the original file.  For example, consider a file with a single character.
Since every code produced by the LZW compressor is <code class=code>12</code>
bits long, the single character file gets replaced by a <code class=code>2</code>
character file (the twelve-bit code gets output as two bytes in this case).
<br><br>
The worst that can happen is that each character of the input file is replaced
by a twelve-bit code. So, if the input file is
<code class=var>n</code> bytes/characters long, the ``compressed file'' is
at most <code class=code>ceil(1.5n)</code> bytes long.
