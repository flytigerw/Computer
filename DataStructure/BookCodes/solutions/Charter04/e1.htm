In each iteration of the <code class=code>do-while</code>
loop, the amount added to <code class=code>elapsedTime</code>
may deviate from the actual run time of
<code class=code>doSomething</code> by up to 100 ms (or 100 ticks).
This error is additive over the iterations and so does not
decline as a fraction of total time.
<br><br>
For example, suppose that <code class=code>doSomething</code>
takes almost 100 ms. to execute.
In the worst case, the clock reading will change just before each
execution of the assignment <code class=code>startTime = clock()</code> and the amount added to
<code class=code>elapsedTime</code> is zero on each iteration of the
<code class=code>do-while</code> loop; the <code class=code>do-while</code>
loop does not terminate.
