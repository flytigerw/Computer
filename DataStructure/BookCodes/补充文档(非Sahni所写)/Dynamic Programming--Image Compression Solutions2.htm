The recursive call is easily replaced by a
<code class=code>while</code> loop.
This transformation causes the segments to be output in the
reverse order from that output by the recursive code.
<br><br>
The nonrecursive traceback method
is given below. A test program, input, and output appear
in the files <code class=code>recursiveDPImageCompression3.*</code>.
This version is expected to run slightly faster as we have replaced
the overhead of method calls by the smaller overhead of a
<code class=code>while</code> loop.

<HR class = coderule>
<pre class = code>
void traceback(int *kay, int n)
{// Output the optimal segment boundaries.
   while (n &gt; 0)
   {
      cout << "New segment begins at "
               + (n - kay[n] + 1) << endl;
      n -= kay[n];
   }
}
