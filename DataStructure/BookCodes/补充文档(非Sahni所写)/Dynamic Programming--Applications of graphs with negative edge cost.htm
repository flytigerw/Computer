Difference Equations
</H3>
An important application of graphs with negative cost edges
and of the Bellman-Ford algorithm is in the
solution of a system of difference equations.
Such a system comprises <code class=var>m</code> equations
of the form
<center>
<code class=var>x<sub>i</sub>-x<sub>j</sub> &lt;= c<sub>q</sub></code>
</center>
where
<code class=var>x<sub>i</sub></code> and <code class=var>x<sub>j</sub></code> are
variables and <code class=var>c<sub>q</sub></code> is a constant.
<br><br>
A <code class=var>4</code> variable system with <code class=var>6</code> equations is given below.
<center>
<code class=var>x<sub>1</sub> - x<sub>2</sub> &lt;= -2<br>
x<sub>1</sub> - x<sub>3</sub> &lt;= -6<br>
x<sub>3</sub> - x<sub>4</sub> &lt;= 5<br>
x<sub>3</sub> - x<sub>2</sub> &lt;= 4<br>
x<sub>2</sub> - x<sub>4</sub> &lt;= 1<br>
x<sub>4</sub> - x<sub>1</sub> &lt;= 1<br></code>
</center>
One application of a system of difference equations is in event
scheduling.  Suppose we are to schedule four related events such that
event <code class=var>2</code> takes place at least two days after event <code class=var>1</code>;
event <code class=var>3</code> takes place at least <code class=var>6</code> days after event <code class=var>1</code>;
event <code class=var>4</code> takes place no more than <code class=var>5</code> days before event <code class=var>3</code>;
event <code class=var>2</code> takes place no more than <code class=var>4</code> days before event <code class=var>3</code>;
event <code class=var>4</code> takes place no more than <code class=var>1</code> day before event <code class=var>2</code>;
and
event <code class=var>1</code> takes place no more than <code class=var>1</code> day before event <code class=var>4</code>.
If we let <code class=var>x<sub>i</sub></code> denote the time
when event <code class=var>i</code> takes place, then the
<code class=var>x<sub>i</sub></code>s must satisfy the
<code class=var>4</code> variable system with <code class=var>6</code> equations given above.
In fact, any assignement of nonnegative integers to
the
<code class=var>x<sub>i</sub></code>s that satisfies all
<code class=var>6</code> equations defines a valid schedule for the <code class=var>4</code> events.
<br><br>
We can transform any system of difference equations into a weighted
digraph as follows.
<OL>
<LI>
The weighted digraph has one vertex for each variable
plus an additional vertex.
<LI>
There is a directed edge from this additional
vertex to each of the remaining vertices.
The weight of each of these edges is zero.
<LI>
For each equation
<code class=var>x<sub>i</sub> - x<sub>j</sub> &lt;= c<sub>q</sub></code>,
there is a directed edge from the vertex that represents
<code class=var>x<sub>j</sub></code>
to the one that represents
<code class=var>x<sub>i</sub></code>
The weight of this edge is
<code class=var>c<sub>q</sub></code>.
</OL>
We shall show shortly that the constructed digraph has a
negative-length cycle iff the system of difference equations it
is constructed from has no solution.  Further, the lengths of the shortest
paths from the additional vertex to the remaining vertex define
a feasible solution when the digraph has no cycle of negative length.
<br><br>
For our <code class=var>4</code> variable <code class=var>6</code> equation example, we let vertex <code class=var>i</code>
represent variable
<code class=var>x<sub>i</sub>, 1 &lt;= i &lt;= 4</code>
and we let vertex <code class=var>5</code> be the additional vertex.  The directed edges and their
costs are <code class=var>{(5,1,0), (5,2,0), (5,3,0), (5,4,0), (2,1,-2), (3,1,-6),
(4,3,5), (2,3,4), (4,2,1), (1,4,1)}</code>, where the triple <code class=var>(u,v,c)</code>
denotes the directed edge from vertex <code class=var>u</code> to
vertex <code class=var>v</code> whose cost is <code class=var>c</code>.
<br><br>
Running the Bellman-Ford algorithm on the constructed digraph
the lengths of the shortest paths from vertex <code class=var>5</code> to vertices <code class=var>1, 2, 3</code>, and <code class=var>4</code>
are determined to be <code class=var>-6, -4, 0</code>, and <code class=var>-5</code>.
The assignment <code class=var>x<sub>1</sub> = -6</code>,
<code class=var>x<sub>2</sub> = -4</code>,
<code class=var>x<sub>3</sub> = 0</code>, and
<code class=var>x<sub>4</sub> = -5</code> satisfies the <code class=var>6</code> equations of our
difference system.  From this assignment, we may obtain other assignments by
adding any constant to all
<code class=var>x<sub>i</sub></code>s.
For example, by adding <code class=var>6</code>, we get the assignment
<code class=var>x<sub>1</sub> = 0</code>,
<code class=var>x<sub>2</sub> = 2</code>,
<code class=var>x<sub>3</sub> = 6</code>, and
<code class=var>x<sub>4</sub> = 3</code>.  Since all times are now nonnegative,
we can use this assignment as a schedule for the <code class=var>4</code> events.

<strong class=var>Theorem</strong>
<OL>
<LI>
The constructed digraph has a negative-length cycle iff the 
system of difference equations it is constructed from has no solution.
<LI>
If the system has a solution, then the lengths of the shortest paths from
the additional vertex to the remaining vertices defines a solution.
</OL>
<br>
<strong class=var>Proof</strong>
<OL>
<LI>
Suppose that the constructed digraph has a negative-length cycle
<code class=var>C</code>.
Without loss of generality, we may assume that this cycle is <code class=var>1, 2, 3, ...,</code>
<code class=var>u</code>, <code class=var>1</code>
where vertex <code class=var>i</code> represents
variable <code class=var>x<sub>i</sub>, 1 &lt;= i
&lt;= u</code>.  Note that the additional vertex is on no
cycle because it has no incoming edge.
The edge <code class=var>(i,i+1)</code> represents the equation
<code class=var>x<sub>i+1</sub> - x<sub>i</sub> &lt;= cost(i,i+1)</code>,
and the edge
<code class=var>(u,1)</code> represents the equation
<code class=var>x<sub>1</sub> - x<sub>u</sub> &lt;= cost(u,1)</code>.
Adding up both sides of the equations represented by the
edges on the negative-length cycle <code class=var>C</code>,
we see that all variables cancel out on the left side to yield a left-side
sum of zero.  The sum of the right sides is the sum of the edge costs
on the cycle.  Since this sum is negative, adding the equations yields the
equation
<center>
<code class=var>0 &lt;= sum of edge costs &lt; 0</code>
</center>
which is a false statement.  Therefore, no assignment to the
<code class=var>x<sub>i</sub></code>s can satisfy the given equations.
<br><br>
The fact that if the system has no solution then the digraph has a
negative-length cycle is established in a similar way.
<LI>
We may assume the digraph has no negative-length cycle.
Consequently, there is a shortest path from the additional vertex
to each of the remaining vertices.  Let <code class=var>d(i)</code>
be the length of the shortest path from the additional vertex to the vertex
<code class=var>i</code> that represents variable <code class=var>x<sub>i</sub></code>.
Let
<code class=var>x<sub>i</sub>-x<sub>j</sub> &lt;= c<sub>q</sub></code>
be any equation in the given system.
From the definition of <code class=var>d()</code> it follows that
<code class=var>d(i) &lt;= d(j) + cost(j,i) = d(j) + c<sub>q</sub></code>.
Therefore,
<code class=var>d(i) - d(j) &lt;= c<sub>q</sub></code>.
Hence setting <code class=var>x<sub>i</sub> = d(i)</code>
for all <code class=var>i</code> results in an assignment that
satisfies all equations.
