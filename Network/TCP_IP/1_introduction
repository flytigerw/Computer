1.Effective communication depends on the use of a common language

2.protocol suite:A collection of related protocols
  architecture or referrence for the protocol suite:The design that specifies how various protocols of a protocol suite relate to each other and divide up tasks to be accomplished

  TCP/IP architecture evolved from the work that addressed the need to provide interconnection between multiple different packet-switched computer networks
  It's accomplished using a set of gateways/routers that provides a translation function between incompatible networks
  
  Designing an architecture is more art than science


3.Up to 1960s,the concept of network is based largely on the telephone network
  A call is normally implemented by establishing a connection between two end points
  Establishing a connection means that a circuit(initially physical circuit) is made between one telephone and another one for the duration of a call
  When the call is completed,the connection is cleared,allowing the circuit to be used by other user's call
  More can be seen in pdf 42

4.Packet switching
  chunks/pakcets of digital information comprising some number of bytes are carried through the network somewhat independently
  Chunks coming from different sources can be mixed together and pulled apart later --> multiplexing
  When packets are received at a packet switch,they are ordinarily stored in buffer memory
  They can be scheduled in FIFO fashion
  FIFO buffer management and on-demand scheduling are easily combined to implement statistical multiplexing in which the traffic is mixed together based on the arrival statistics or timing pattern of the traffic
  The downside of this approach is limited predictability ---> The performance seen by any particular app depends on the statistics of other apps that are sharing the network

  time-division multiplexing and static multiplexing typically reserve a certain amount of time or other resources for data on each connection
  They can lead more predictability but may not utilize the network capacity because unreserved bandwith may go unused

  virtual circuit:It can exhibit many of the behaviours of circuit but does't depend on phsycial circuit switches and can be implemented atop connection-oriented packets
  The VC abstraction and connection-oriented packet networks requires some information or state stored in each switch on each connection
  Each packet carries only a small bit of overhead information that provides an index to a state table
  Ex:
   Logical Channel Identifier(LCI) and Logical Channel Number(LCN) are used in conjunction with per-flow state at switch to determine the next switch along the path for the packet
   The per-flow state is established prior to the exchange of the data on a VC using a signling protocol that supports connection establishment,clearing and status information
  
   Datagram is a special type of packet in which all the identifying informaiton of the source and destination reside in the packet itself instead of in the packet switches
   Message boundaries can be seen in pdf 44

5.When a large system such as an opearting system and protocol suite are being designed,a question often arise as to where a particular feature or function should be placed
  One of the most important principals that influences the design of TCP/IP suite is end-to-end argument
  It argues that the correctness and completeness can be achieved only by involving the app or the ultimate user of the communication system ---> The important functions(error control,delivery ack) should usually not be implemented at low levels of the system
  
  Fate sharing suggests placing all the necessary states to maintain an active communication association at the same location with communicating endpoints
  With this reasoning,the only type of failure that destroys communication is one that also destroy one or more endpoints


6.There are some circumstances where the data within the network is damaged and lost
  It can be for a variety of reason such as hardware problem,radition that modifies the bits while being transmitted
,being out of range in a wireless network
  Error control can be implemented in the systems constituting the network infrastructure 
  The end-to-end argument and fate sharing would suggest that the error control be implemented close to or within the app

  best-effort delivery:The network doesn't expand much effort to ensure the data is delivered without errors.Certain types of errors are detected using error-detecting codes or checksums.When such errors are detected,errant datagram is merely discarded instead of being retransmitted
  
  If best-delivery is successful,a fast sender can produce information at a rate that exceeds the receiver's ability to consume it
  flow control that operate outside the network layer and at higher levels of the communication system is used to slow down the fast sender.In particular,TCP handles this problem

7.With layering,each layer is responsible for a different facet of communications
  Open Systems Interconnection(OSI)
  1.Application
    It specifies methods for accomplishing user-initiated task
    The protocol should be devised and implemented by app developers
    Ex:FTP

  2.Presentation
    It specifies the methods of expressing data formats and translation rules for apps
    Ex:character encoding conversion

  3.Session
    It specifies the methods for multiple connections constituting a communication session

  4.Transport
    It specifies the methods for connections or associations between multiple programs runing on the same computer system
    TCP protocol 

  5.Network
    It specifies the methods for communicating in a multihop fashion across potentailly different types of networks
    For packet network,it describes an abstract packet format and its standard addressing structrue
    IP protocol 
  
  6.Link
    It includes methods and protocols for establishing connectivty to a neighbor sharing the same medium
    When more than one neighbor access the same shared network,the network is said to be a multi-access network(WI-FI and Ethernet)
    Error detection is often included in this laryer,along with link-layer address formats
    Ex:Ethernet,WI-FI

  7.Physical
    It specifies connectors,data rates and how bits are encoded on the same media and defines the methods of moving digital information across a communication media
    Portions of Ethernet and WI-FI standards are here
    It also supports low-level detection and correction
    

9.ARPNET reference model can be seen in pdf 14
  
  Transport layer protocol 
   1)TCP(Transmission Control Protocol)
   2)UDP(User Datagram Protocol)
   3)DCCP(Datagram Congestion Control Protocol)
     It provides a type of service midway between TCP and UDP:connection-oriented exchange of unreliable datagrams but with congestion control
    Congestion control consists of a number of techniques whereby a sender is limited to a sending rate to avoid overwhelming the network
   4)SCTP(Stream Control Transmission Protocol)
     It provides reliable delivery like TCP but doesn't require the sequencing of data to be strictly maintained
     It also allows multiple streams to logically be carried on the same connection and provides a message abstraction
  
  Application layer
    It's concerned with the details of the app and not with the movement of data across the network
    The lower layers are oppsite:They know nothing about the app but handles all communication details
    
10.At each layer,there is an id that allows the receiving system to determine which protocol and datastream belongs together
  Example explains how demultiplexing from the link layer is performered
   1.An arriving Ethernet frame contains a 48-bit address(MAC-Media Access Control) and 16-bit field called Ethernet type which is used to select which network protocol to be used 
    A value of 0x0800 indicates that the frame contains an IPv4 datagram 
    0x0806 and 0x86DD indicate ARP and IPv6 repsectively
    If the destination address matches one of the receiving system' address,then the frame is received and checked for errors.

  2)The IP datagram contained in the received frame is given to IP for processing
    IP checks the destination IP address in the datagram.
    If the address matches one of its own and the datagram contains no error in its header,then the 8-bit IPv4 protocol filed is checked to determine which protocol is to invoke next
    Common values: 1(ICMP),2(IGMP),4(IPv4),6(TCP),7(UDP)
  3)The resuling datagram(reassemble from fragments if necessary) is passed to transport layer for processing
    At the transport layer,most protocols use port numbers for demultiplexing to appropriate receiving app

11.internet means multiple networks connected together using a common protocol suite
   Internet refers to a collection of hosts around the world that can communicate with each other using TCP/IP
   intranet refers to a private network usually run by a enterprise
     It provides access to resources avaliable only to members of the particular enterprise 
     Users may connect to the intranet using a virtual private network(VPN) 
    
   The easiest way to build an internet is to connect two networks with a router
   A router is a special-purpose device for connecting networks
   It provides connections for many differnet types of physical networks:Ethernet,WI-FI,DSL,point-to-point links 
   The value of computer network is proportional to the square of the number of connected endpoints

12.Some applications are desigened in a more distributed fashion where there is no single server
   Instead,each app acts both as a server and as client and is capable of forwarding requests
   A concurrent p2p app may receive an incoming request,determine if it's able to respond the request and if not,forwards the request to some other peer
   One of the primary problems in p2p apps is the discovery problem
   How does one peer find which other peers can peovide the data or service it wants in a network where the peers may come and go
   It's usually handled by a bootstraping procedure whereby each client is initially configured with the addresses and port numbers of some peers that are likely to be operating

13.Attacks involving the Internet architecture
   Internet architecture delivers IP datagram based on destination IP addresses
   As a result,the malicious uses can insert whatever IP address they choose into source IP address field of each datagram they send
   It may be difficult or impossible to determine the origin of a datagram received from Internet
   Denial-of-service(Dos) attacks usually involve so much important resource that legitaimate users are denied service
